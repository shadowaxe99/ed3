**Shared Dependencies**

1. **Data Schemas**: Influencer, Brand, and Partnership schemas will be shared across backend models, services, and controllers. These schemas will define the structure of the data in the PostgreSQL database.

2. **Function Names**: Functions such as `getMatchingBrands()`, `acceptPartnership()`, and `rejectPartnership()` will be shared across backend services, controllers, and frontend components.

3. **Redux Actions and Reducers**: Actions such as `FETCH_MATCHING_BRANDS`, `ACCEPT_PARTNERSHIP`, and `REJECT_PARTNERSHIP` will be shared across Redux actions and reducers files. Reducers such as `brandMatchingReducer` and `partnershipManagementReducer` will be shared across Redux store and components.

4. **DOM Element IDs**: IDs such as `brand-list`, `accept-button`, and `reject-button` will be shared across frontend components and tests.

5. **Test Names**: Test names such as `testBrandMatching()` and `testPartnershipManagement()` will be shared across backend and frontend test files.

6. **Config Variables**: Configuration variables such as `DATABASE_URL`, `REACT_APP_API_URL` will be shared across backend and frontend files.

7. **Docker and Kubernetes Configurations**: Dockerfile and Kubernetes configuration files (deployment.yaml, service.yaml) will share the app name, version, and other deployment-related configurations.

8. **Gitignore**: The .gitignore file will share the list of files and directories that should be ignored by Git.

9. **README**: The README.md file will share the project name, description, setup instructions, and other project-related information.
