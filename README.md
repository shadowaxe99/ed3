5. **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes

## Non-functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: The matching algorithm is efficient and provides suggestions quickly.
2. **Reliability**: The system is reliable and available 24/7.
3. **Machine Learning**: A machine learning algorithm is implemented to improve the accuracy of brand partnership suggestions over time.
4. **Brand Preferences**: Influencers can set preferences for the types of brands they are interested in partnering with.
